## Ruby Refresher

#### A series of rspec tests to pass. This challenge was set on week 7 at Makers Academy. We had spent the previous two weeks on Javascript so this refresher challenge was set before we revisited Ruby.

- [ ] Questions 31-40 complete
- [ ] Question 40 + complete

###The Objective

Here we're going to revisit the basics of Ruby. There are 41 questions - you don't have to do every single one (although if you can, that's great). You should be able to do at least 50% of them. They vary in level from quite easy to fairly hard. Work through them and check if they're correct by running the specs.

You should be able to answer most questions with a couple of lines of code, and just a few methods. If you're writing a long, complex solution, there's probably a better way.

### Rules

* Try and get the RSpec tests to pass (but not by cheating - i.e. hardcoding the expected value)
* You shouldn't need any extra libraries or gems
* The cleaner your code the better!
* Googling is fine as usual

### How To Use

To run the specs, just run

~~~
$ rspec questions_spec.rb
~~~

**Quick tip**: to run a single example, change `it` to `fit` on that example, then run

~~~
$ rspec questions_spec.rb --tag focus
~~~
